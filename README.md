# üåê Ton Swap SmartContract

Welcome to the **Ton Swap SmartContract** repository! This project is the backbone of a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the TON blockchain, enabling secure and efficient token swaps, liquidity provision, and DeFi operations. If you're interested in leveraging the power of the TON blockchain for decentralized trading, you've come to the right place.

## üìú Overview

Ton Swap SmartContract is a robust set of smart contracts designed for swapping tokens and managing liquidity pools within the TON ecosystem. Built for speed, security, and scalability, these contracts empower users with a seamless trading experience while maintaining full decentralization.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Token Swapping**: Facilitates the exchange of TON-based tokens in a fully decentralized manner.
- **Liquidity Pools**: Users can provide liquidity to pools, earn rewards, and contribute to the stability of the ecosystem.
- **Non-Custodial**: Users retain full control over their assets‚Äîno intermediaries, no centralized risk.
- **Efficient Transactions**: Built on the TON blockchain, enabling high-speed, low-fee transactions.
- **Modular and Extensible**: Designed with scalability in mind, making it easy to extend and integrate additional features.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the structure of this repository:

- **`contracts/`**: Contains the smart contracts written for token swaps, liquidity pools, and other DEX functionalities.
- **`scripts/`**: Includes deployment and management scripts to interact with the contracts.
- **`test/`**: Unit tests to ensure the reliability and security of the smart contracts.
